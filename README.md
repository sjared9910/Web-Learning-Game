# Web Based Learning Game
This was a group project aimed at creating a learning game for testing current and incoming employees to verify their knowledge in a subject. This program uses SQL Server to implement different testing subjects 
and questions that the games created can pull from.
# Features
- Login Page with database implementation to verify logins and create accounts
- Cross site sessions for storing game information into the database
- Catalog of games to play
- Database backend GUI for creating and accessing database contents
- Visual accessibility with dark mode
# Usage
This program requires the use of SQL Server for the database as well as XAMPP for implementing the PHP server side scripting language. For this program to work, the server connections variable in each PHP file will need to be modified
for the connection settings that match your SQL Server.
